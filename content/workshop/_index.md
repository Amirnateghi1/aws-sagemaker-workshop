description: "Amazon SageMaker Autopilot automatically trains and tunes the best machine learning models for classification or regression, based on your data while allowing to maintain full control and visibility. With SageMaker Autopilot, you provide a tabular dataset and select the target column to predict, which can be a number (such as a house price, called regression), or a category (such as spam/not spam, called classification). SageMaker Autopilot will automatically explore different solutions to find the best model. You then can directly deploy the model to production with just one click, or iterate on the recommended solutions with Amazon SageMaker Studio to further improve the model quality.

In this workshop, we will walk you through the components required to build and train a Machine Learning model using SageMakers new AutoPilot.
