[Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/amazon_sagemaker_operators_for_kubernetes.html) make it easier for developers and data scientists using Kubernetes to train, tune, and deploy machine learning (ML) models in [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). You can install these SageMaker Operators on your Kubernetes cluster in [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) to create SageMaker jobs natively using the Kubernetes API and command-line Kubernetes tools such as ‘kubectl’. 

In this workshop, you'll see how to use SageMaker operators to train and deploy a machine learning model, get inferences from the deployed model, and integrate these steps into a [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) pipeline.

*After completing the workshop, remember to complete the [cleanup](/workshop-k8s-operators/next) section to remove any unnecessary AWS resources.*
