### Advanced TensorFlow Design (Optional)

In the last chapter, we used a very simple TensorFlow model.  In this chapter we'll work on making the model more advanced.

This chapter is optional and assumes some knowledge of TensorFlow 2.0 programming.  You can always skip to the [next section](/workshop-k8s-operators/next).
