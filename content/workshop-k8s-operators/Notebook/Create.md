The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is often used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and more.

In the Kubeflow dashboard, click on `Create a new Notebook server`.  Give your notebook a name like `mynotebook`.  For the Image, choose the Tensorflow 2 image for CPU.  Change the `CPU` field to use 1.0 rather than 0.5.

Accept all the other default settings and click `Launch`.  Once the notebook comes online, click on `Connect`.
