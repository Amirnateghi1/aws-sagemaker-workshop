The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is often used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and more.  We'll use a Jupyter notebook to register the pipeline so we can explore the pipeline code interactively.

First, clone this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/shashankprasanna/kubeflow-pipelines-sagemaker-examples) into a working directory.  

If necessary, install [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).  Go into your working directory and launch Jupyter Lab:

    jupyter-lab
