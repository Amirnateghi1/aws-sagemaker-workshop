### Training with SageMaker Studio

There are multiple scenarios for training a model in the Amazon SageMaker environment: 

* __Use an algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker Studio__
* Submit custom code (script) to train with AWS built-in frameworks
* Use your own custom algorithms
* Use Apache Spark with Amazon SageMaker Studio
* Use an algorithm that you subscribe to from AWS Marketplace

### Training with Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms

Amazon SageMaker provides built-in training algorithms. If one of these meets your needs, it's a great out-of-the-box solution for quick model training.
