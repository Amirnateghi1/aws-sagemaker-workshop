# Machine Learning Training


Amazon SageMaker Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for machine learning (ML) that lets you easily build, train, debug, deploy and monitor your machine learning models.

SageMaker Studio gives you complete access, control, and visibility into each step required to build, train, and deploy models. You can quickly upload data, create new notebooks, train and tune models, move back and forth between steps to adjust experiments, compare results, and deploy models to production all in one place, making you much more productive. All ML development activities including notebooks, experiment management, automatic model creation, debugging, and model drift detection can be performed within the unified SageMaker Studio visual interface.

In this workshop you will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker Studio to train your models.
